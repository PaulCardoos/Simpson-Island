This is a program that simulates an island that a character from the simpson is stuck on. This character has an obsession with business cards of all different dimensions. The only way he can leave the island is if he collects 7 businessc cards in which he can stack (largest to smallest) or if he visits 14 different businesses. Message me at Paul.Cardoos001@umb.edu if you have any further questions, happy to share the prompt with you.
